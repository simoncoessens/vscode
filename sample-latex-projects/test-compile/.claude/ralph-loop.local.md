I want that we chang
      the entire way the editor works. I always want the pdf to be opened on the right (Like in Overleaf) (and with a recompile button on the top).
                                                                                                                                                   
     There should be no way to make it dissapear. So every time a project is opened, the pdf viewer must show on the right.
